# Nara - Implemented Features

This document outlines the features implemented in the Nara deer companion app.

## Core Features

### Mood Selection with Deer Companion Integration
- **Description**: Enhanced the mood selection feature to directly connect with the deer companions. When a user selects their mood, the relevant deer character appears with their info card.
- **Implementation**: Modified the `selectMood` function to display the appropriate deer info popup based on the selected mood. Each mood maps to a deer with a complementary personality:
  - Happy → Oliver (social, cheerful deer)
  - Neutral → Atlas (practical, organized deer)
  - Sad → Willow (thoughtful, introspective deer)
  - Stressed → Luna (nurturing and patient deer)
  - Tired → Hazel (gentle deer)
- **User Experience**: Users can now immediately interact with a deer after sharing their mood, without needing to find and hover over them in the scene.

### Enhanced Deer Character Profiles
- **Description**: Improved the deer character profiles with more structured system prompts.
- **Implementation**: Reformatted all deer character system prompts with a clear structure:
  - Identity: Clearly defines who the deer is
  - Instructions: Specific guidelines for response style and content
  - Signature: Consistent signing format
- **User Experience**: The deer companions now have more consistent personalities and provide more relevant, focused responses.

## Custom Features

### Accessible API Key Management
- **Description**: Added a dedicated button for deleting the OpenAI API key directly from the main interface.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created a new button with the OpenAI "eye" icon next to the reset button
  - Button only appears when an API key exists
  - Confirms before deletion and shows success message
  - Updates all related UI elements when the key is deleted
- **User Experience**: Users can now easily manage their API key privacy without navigating through menus. The prominent placement and color change on hover (turning red) emphasizes the security aspect of this feature.

### Improved Deer Info Cards
- **Description**: Enhanced the deer info cards with additional context about why users might want to talk to each deer.
- **Implementation**: Added an explanation section to each deer's info card that includes their personality description, helping users understand which deer might be most helpful for their current needs.
- **User Experience**: Users can make more informed choices about which deer to interact with based on their specific situation or goals.

## Technical Improvements

- Improved focus management in modal dialogs for better accessibility

### Style Consistency
